<!--Some time mouse specific action are important, like keyboard event
Vue provides 3 modifiers; left, middle and right.
These 3 modifiers, can be used with mouse related events to respond accordingly.
Specifically, all these 3 modifiers work with mouse down and mouse up events.
However, beyond the mouse up and mouse up events, these 3 modifiers provide limited support for
mouse related events for that reason, I like to discuss left, middle and right modifiers more closely.

Left modifier: Empower you to respond to a user interacting with the left mouse button.
Ex: Imagine there is area on web page, I want to react to the user clicking on 

Middle mouse modifier: Helps to respond to the user interacting with middle mouse button.
This modifier is rarely used. There are only 2 mouse related event support onmuse down and up

Right modifier: Helps to respond to user interacting with right mouse button. It doesnot work with
click evetn. contextmenu event works only with right button
