   As application grows in size, it becomes more complex. This complexity emergy as a html

   Proactively identify and address the side effect. To do this:

<!-- @@ Understanding Event Propagation @@
When events has invoked, they can start change reaction. This can happen because by default events in html
DOM are propagated through visual tree.
EX: Imagine that search button, Sample sinppet for event propagation.
-->
<div v-on:click="GrandParentClick">
    <div v-on:click="ParentClick">
        <button v-on:click="executeSearch">Search</button>
    </div>

<!--Event can bubble up or they can get captured.
        When an event bubbles, the element that was selected, invokes the event first.
        Context of the search button example, Search button first, event bubble up to the ancister element.
        Each ancister respond to the click event, if they wanted to.
        This is the default approch used by Vue.    
    There is a way to event capturing, if

<!-- @@ Event Capturing @@ 
Event capturing should be used, if I want event to be handled, oppsit word of event bubbling.
Event handling starts at the window object. 
The order downs through visual tree. All the way down of the target.
Bubble up - capture down.

Event capturing was introduced by Nestely, in early days of the web.
Microsoft introduces the bubbling up. Which is the default approach today.
W3C supported both the approach.
Since Vue complements web technology so well, it naturally supports both bubbling and event capturing.
In vue, event capturing applied on an element via "capture modifier". "Capture modifier" - choose like
other modifier. Simply append dot after name of the event and apply the name of the modifier.
If Capture modifier has applied to the search button code, shown earlier, it look like   

      Propagates event from the top to bottom. Event handler are executed from top to bottom.
